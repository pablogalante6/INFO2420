	<li>I personally like that it sends my attention towards the object in the center, which is clearly the highlight. It's simple, easy to read, and has neat lines dividing text. I like that it isn't cluttered with lots of text.</li>
	<li>Links on this site are organized on the top with a navigation bar, as well as on the titles of each section. Text, and pictures serve as links.</li>
	<li>The site structure does not confuse me, due to its simplicity and contrast. It isn't symmetrical, but that doesn't distract me from anything. The structure makes sense, due to all of the links it has on it. A simple heading with a simple description and a link on everything, shows the main purpose is to inform a user about news in music.</li>
	<li>When it comes to the graphics, layout and multimedia, I don't think there is too much at all. It's very clean, loads quickly, and I don't have to wait for tons of data to load. It carries a few animations here and there, with links that are underlined or are highlighted on mouse hover. Nothing that distracts me from what I am seeing.</li>
	<li>This site loads really quickly, and I believe it has to do with the fact that it is simple, isn't overwhelming or cluttered with animations, text, images, videos, etc. The load time was reasonable for what is being displayed.</li>
	<li>The text color is easily readable. Black on white is a great option for contrast. There is no background image, making it even easier to read anything on the site. No need to worry about changing the color of any text to make it readable over an image.</li>
	<li>This site does include a navigation bar, and it's centered at the top of the web page. It seems to be well done, with the links being a single word that slightly change color as they are highlighted with the mouse.</li>
	<li>The color scheme seems to be black, white, and gray. The only other colors are on album covers, pictures of artists, or on the videos. Everything fits well together, and there isn't a single page that is different enough to get me to think I am suddenly on another site.</li>
	<li>The site responds very well on different sizes of screens. The navigation bar shrinks to where it disappears, and I can access it with a menu button. Thumbnails, text, layout, and more shrinks to fit better on the screen no matter the size.</li>
	<li>One thing this site does really well is follow a pattern with how links are organized. There is a picture, or gif with a genre, the name of the album, the name of the artist, with a short description no matter the tab the user is visiting.</li>
